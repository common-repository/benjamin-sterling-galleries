Benjamin Sterling Galleries provides an interface to set up gallery widgets using Picasa / Flickr / Wordpress Uploads and jQuery

== Description ==

*Note:* This plugin has been renamed and revised with some major improvements, the new plugin is located at [PhotoXhibit](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/photoxhibit/ "PhotoXhibit")

This plugin is called Benjamin Sterling Galleries and its purpose is to allow you to use your Flickr or Picasa account and to post those images together in one photo / image gallery. Yes, I know, there are already Wordpress plugins that work with picasa and/or with flickr. However, although this is true, I have not gotten a single one of them to work without hacking something and they only either worked with picasa or flickr but not both. "I am using one of those plugins now and it works fine, what makes yours so special?" jQuery! "Can you elaborate?" Yes, my plugin utilizes jQuery to do all the heavy lifting and it uses some very good photo gallery plugins that were writen for jQuery by myself and some other very gifted individuals.

These are the current jQuery image / photo gallery plugins that are installed into the system:

* [jqGalView](http://benjaminsterling.com/jquery-jqgalview-photo-gallery/ "Image/Photo Gallery Viewer using jQuery")
* [jqGalViewII](http://benjaminsterling.com/jquery-jqgalviewii-photo-gallery/ "jQuery: jqGalViewII (Photo Gallery)")
* [jqGalScroll](http://benjaminsterling.com/jquery-jqgalscroll-photo-gallery/ "jQuery: jqGalScroll 2.0 (Photo Gallery)")
* [cycle](http://jquery.com/plugins/project/cycle "Cycle Plugin")

There is a long list of additions/advancements I want to do with this plugin, but your feedback and input would be most appreciated.

Full support will be handled at the [plugin's website](http://benjaminsterling.com/benjaminsterlinggalleries/ "http://benjaminsterling.com/benjaminsterlinggalleries/")

== Requests == 
This is a very young project and I plan on working on it till it gets to a level where it does what we need it to do.  So I am looking for suqqestions, improvements, feature requests and any feedback on usablity.

Please submit requests to [http://benjaminsterling.com/benjaminsterlinggalleries/](http://benjaminsterling.com/benjaminsterlinggalleries/)

== Updates == 

There were some conflicts with some themes and some other functionality within wordpress and those conflicts have been fixed.  The conflict was between the way the Prototype and jQuery frameworks play together.  I set it up so that the jQuery library is loaded last and this should fix any conflicts.

There were some request to be able to grab the images and photos already uploaded to the blog so I put that option in.  I tested it the best I could, but since I personally don't upload images to be blog, I was not able to fully test it so I would like any and all feedback on this feature.

There were some issues that after submitting a flickr gallery that no images were returned so some more error checking was built in to resolve this issue.

As I said before, this is a young system and would like to get any and all feedback on it to make it better.  If there are any jQuery, or any other frameworks for that matter, galleries that you would like to be included into the mix, please let me know.
